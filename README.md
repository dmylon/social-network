### Project Description

ChitChat is a Twitter-like social media website, that allows users to share their thoughts, like posts, and follow other users. This website was developed back in March 2021 as a small project made for fun and getting familiar with full stack development technologies like HTML,CSS, JavaScript and Python(Django). By no means it is intended to be put into production or used for any commercial purposes. In the current version, the platform is designed to be desktop-only.

By first visiting the website, it is required to be logged in, or create a new account if there one does not exist.

After logging in, the user views the main page, in which they can create a new post, view all other user's posts, and like them if they want. Also, for their own posts, users have an edit option in which they can change the content of a previous made post.

When clicking in a username, a profile page is shown, containing the number of followers and following users, and the posts made by this person. In addition, there is a follow/unfollow option.
